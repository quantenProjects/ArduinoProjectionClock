# ArduinoProjectionClock
Uses a 8x8 LED Matrix to project the Time onto a wall

Have a look in the Dev tree :)

# How to use it

You need to install the LEDMatrix7219 library http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=77 
Then copy the usd.c file into yout library folder, but the folder structure in github should be right, if you extract the complete github zip to your /Documents/Arduino/ folder.
Now open the sketch, follow the wiring, which is discribed in the comments and press upload. :)
